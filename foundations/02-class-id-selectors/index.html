<!--class selectors will select all elements with the given
class, which is just an attribute you place on an HTML 
element. classes aren't required to be specific to a '
particular element so you can use the same class on 
as many elements as you want.-->
<!--ID selectors are similar to class sectors
they select an element with theh given ID which is anothher
attribute you place on an HTML element.
the major difference between classes and IDs is that an 
elemenet can only have one ID and cannot be repeated on a single
page and should not contain any whitespace. -->
